### foss lab
these are very much amateur scripts written when i was learning basic unix commands as well as shell scripting. honestly i would never refer these solutions the amateur me had done during that time, if i were you! :sweat_smile:    

but feel free to make use of ```basic_commands.pdf``` file, which contains basic questions that you could work out by yourself.  

the scripts that i use on a daily basis for a productive workflow can be found in [my dotfiles](https://github.com/yedhink/dotfiles_ikigai). now those you can definitely refer to! :wink:
