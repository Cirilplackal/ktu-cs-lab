* Objective
** Producers and consumers requests a processs
** buffer can only be used by one of these processes
** if buffer full then
*** cant produce more
*** consumer has to consume something
** if buffer empty then
*** cant consume more
*** producer has to produce something

* Constraints
** the buffer size is fixed while doing in lab \(..)/
   
* Functions
** pthread_create(...)
*** pthread_t *thread
**** its the thread id
*** const pthread_attr_t *attr
**** the default value for attr = NULL
*** void *(*start_routine) (void *)
**** its the function that the thread should work on
*** void *arg
**** the params for that function

** sem_init(...)
*** semaphore to be initialized(of type sem_t)
*** can be either 0 or 1. 0 means semaphore is shared bw threads of a process
*** value to be intialized to semaphore
**** increments the value

** sem_wait(...)
*** name of semaphore to be waited out/decremented
**** decements the value

** pthread_join(...)
*** thread name
**** waits untill this thread is terminated.
**** avoids zombie processes
